# Crime-Rate-Prediction
Crime is a prevalent issue in cities worldwide, with criminal offenses being committed by individuals referred to as criminals. While every crime is a violation of the law, not all violations are considered crimes.
In India, some cities have higher rates of violent crime, including illegal drug trade, human trafficking, corruption, and violations against women. To combat these crimes, steps must be taken. One approach is to 
use machine learning models such as k-means, KNN, and Gradient boosting classifier to predict crime rates. The Gradient boosting classifier has shown an accuracy of 99.8%, while the K nearest neighbor algorithm has
an accuracy of 98.5%.
